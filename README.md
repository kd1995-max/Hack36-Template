## Introduction:
In line with the vision of our Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi, we code harpers are calling for "vocal pe local". We are pleased to announce that we are targeting small artists who don't get the attention that big artists and art galleries receive, although anybody with a good piece of art can inspire their clients through the platform. The vision is there will eventually be a time when no artist with their work will be left out. We will allow artists to upload their paintings and will provide a platform for their work to make money from home.
